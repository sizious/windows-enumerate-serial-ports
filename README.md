# EnumCom: Windows Enumerate Serial Ports

EnumCom is a simple Microsoft Windows executable and/or library to retrieve the list of all serial (COM) ports available on the system.

## Build

If you want to make:

* The standalone executable: `make`.
* The library: `make LIBRARY=1`.

## Usage

This library was made mainly for [DreamSDK](https://dreamsdk.org), which contains components written in Free Pascal/Lazarus. That's why you have an example of sample FPC code to call this library in the `dbg` directory.
